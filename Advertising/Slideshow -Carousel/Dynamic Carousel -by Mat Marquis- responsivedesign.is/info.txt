If there’s one thing that can compete with lightboxes for “world’s most done-to-death jQuery 
plugin,” it’s carousels. Everything Mat came across was using pixel values and not percentages—
meaning nothing that could be used on a responsive/flexible layout. So Mat built one.

The creator of this plugin has done a lot of awesome responsive design things especially around 
responsive images (and in this case the little cart that takes them around the page).
