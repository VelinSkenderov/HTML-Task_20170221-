Microsoft Office FrontPage - Създайте Ваш собствен уеб сайт без да използвате кодове
В момента нямаме отзиви за софтуера: Microsoft Office FrontPage, версия 2003. Ако искате да 
напишете отзив за този софтуер, моля, направете го и го изпратете и ние с удоволствие ще го 
включим тук. 

Creating a presence on the Internet opens up a world of opportunity. You can share ideas, 
information and do business with anyone in the whole world with a web site. Learning how to 
everything from scratch using languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and Python can be a 
laborious and time consuming process however. Microsoft FrontPage lets you design your own web 
site without having to learn all this code.
By using an intuitive ‘What You See Is What You Get’ system, even a complete novice can create 
their own dynamic webpages quickly and easily. Microsoft even provides an online course to get 
you familiarised with FrontPage and web design concepts like web servers and publishing. 
FrontPage will let you choose how much detail you want to get involved in as well. View the 
automatically generated HTML code as you go using the Split View option, or hide it completely 
and just get on with your site building. Create design templates to speed up your work and 
create a uniform look and feel for your site. Create interactive buttons for better navigation 
and utilise the built in accessibility checker to check that your website complies with 
standards (will display properly on all browsers).
