PDF merge

Merge is the most used PDFsam Basic module and lets you combine PDF files together
Page ranges

Input PDF files can be merged completely or partially. A page selection can be set in the form of comma separated page intervals (Ex. 1-10, 14, 25-) letting you specify what pages you want to merge for every input PDF file
Bookmarks

Set what to do with the bookmarks of the merged PDF files. You can merge them together, discard them to keep the resulting file smaller or create a new bookmarks tree with one entry for every merged PDF file
AcroForms

Set what to do with AcroForms when they are found in the input PDF file. You can discard them but also merge them into a new form or even merge them renaming fields with name clashes
Table of contents

Add a table of contents at the beginning of the generated PDF. A list of clickable entries will let you easily navigate through the merged PDF files
