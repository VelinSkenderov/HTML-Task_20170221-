“Overrides AMD and NVIDIA settings and create custom resolutions”
A review of Custom Resolution Utility by Sven Sørensen

Custom Resolution Utility is a small freeware utility which can tweak your NVIDIA and AMD 
graphics cards to create higher resolutions.

As a portable application, CRU does not require installation and can be run without 
installation.

The layout of the program provides a list of currently supported resolutions for your 
monitor with the option to add new ones.

The application isn't perfect, but if your monitor can support higher and/or different 
resolutions from what's displayed in your graphics control panel, Custom Resolution Utility 
will create EDID values in the registry so that you may select the resolutions in your 
graphics settings.

Currently supported GPUs are limited to some AMD/ATI and NVIDIA cards, as Intel GPUs are 
not supported.

It's worth pointing out that you should have an idea of what your monitor and GPU are 
capable of. If anything goes wrong, the download comes with an app called "reset-all.exe" 
which can be run to revert any changes you have made with Custom Resolution Utility.

Custom Resolution Utility features and highlights:
Detailed resolutions are the preferred way to add custom resolutions 
The first detailed resolution is considered the preferred or native resolution 
HDMI is treated as single-link DVI unless an HDMI support data block is defined in the 
first extension block 
HDMI limits depend on the graphics card 
AMD/ATI's driver also listens to the TMDS clock limit in the HDMI support data block 
Passive DisplayPort to HDMI adapters are limited to 165 MHz unless the driver is patched


Custom Resolution Utility is licensed as Freeware for Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) operating system / platform from video tweaks without restrictions. Custom Resolution Utility 1.4.1 is available to all software users as a free download (Freeware).
