  <p class="question">
  Q: Who created Inc.?
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  A: Inc. was created by by two couples who were frustrated over the fact that there hasn't been any innovation in financial board games in decades. To get the
  full scope of how Inc. came to be, please refer to the About Us section of this Web site.
  </p>
  <p class="question">
  Q: Is Inc. just another Monopoly?
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  A: No, and we resent you asking! SEriously, we get this question a lot and the answer is that the only similarity between Inc and Monopoly is that both games
  involve money. That's about it. Inc is unlike any game you've ever played, and has a very different feel than Monopoly. We are fans of Monopoly, and feel that
  it is a great real estate dinancial game. Our goal in creating Inc. was not to improve on Monopoly, but to throw out all that we knew and create the ultimate
  financial board game
