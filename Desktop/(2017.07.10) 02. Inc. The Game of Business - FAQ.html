	<h4>General</h4>
	<p class="question">
	Q: Who created Inc.?
	</p>
	<p class="answer">
	A: Inc. was created by by two couples who were frustrated over the fact that there hasn't been any innovation in financial board games in decades. To get the
  full scope of how Inc. came to be, please refer to the About Us section of this Web site.
	</p>
	<p class="question">
	Q: Is Inc. just another Monopoly?
	</p>
	<p class="answer">
	A: No, and we resent you asking! SEriously, we get this question a lot and the answer is that the only similarity between Inc and Monopoly is that both games
  involve money. That's about it. Inc is unlike any game you've ever played, and has a very different feel than Monopoly. We are fans of Monopoly, and feel that
  it is a great real estate dinancial game. Our goal in creating Inc. was not to improve on Monopoly, but to throw out all that we knew and create the ultimate
  financial board game. Our goal in creating Inc. was not to improve on Monopoly, but to throw out all that we know and create the ultimate financial board game
  centered around the entrepreneurial spirit of starting and growing businesses.
    <p class="question">
	Q: What's the deal with the strange packaging of Inc.?
	</p>
	<p class="answer">
	A: Part of the development of Inc. Involved rethinking the traditional box in which most games are packaged. We warried game to be extremely durable yet easy
	to transport. After trying many different packaging ideas and testing numerous prototypes, we finally settled on a luminated mat and rugged tube. The
	luminated mat is completely spill-proof, while the tube is much easier to tote around than a traditional board gamr box.
