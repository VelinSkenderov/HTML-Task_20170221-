	In these photos, he's catching a little air off of a jump located on the Right Loop of the Tsali trail, as well as cruising by <a href="http://www.greatsmokies.com/community/fontana.htm" title="Fontana Lake">Fontana Lake</a> on the Left Loop. The jump picture shows the last in a series that has provided a change of pace from the fast descents and smooth climbs. The cruise picture shows how tha water in the lake has lowered due to dam maintenence.
