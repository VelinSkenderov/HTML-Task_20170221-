  </p>
  <p class="answer">

  <p class="question">
  Q: Is Inc. just another Monopoly?
  </p>
  <p class="answer">
  A: No, and we resent you asking! SEriously, we get this question a lot and the answer is that the only similarity between Inc and Monopoly is that both games
  involve money. That's about it. Inc is unlike any game you've ever played, and has a very different feel than Monopoly. We are fans of Monopoly, and feel that
  it is a great real estate dinancial game. Our goal in creating Inc. was not to improve on Monopoly, but to throw out all that we knew and create the ultimate
  financial board game
