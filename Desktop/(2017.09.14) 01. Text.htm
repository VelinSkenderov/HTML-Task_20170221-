    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
	<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New
	   Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>.
	   It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be
	   free.</p>
	<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the
	   refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the
	   llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something
	   better to do.</p>
