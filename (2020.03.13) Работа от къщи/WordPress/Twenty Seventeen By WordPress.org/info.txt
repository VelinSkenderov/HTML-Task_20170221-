Twenty Seventeen brings your site to life with header video and immersive featured images. With a focus on business 
sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and 
more. Personalize its asymmetrical grid with a custom color scheme and showcase your multimedia content with post 
formats. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.
